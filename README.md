mathchat
========

if you like to talk math, this is the system for you

A WORD OF CAUTION
=================

This thing is a serious prototype, so it's probably going to break.  Yay!

Also it's missing a bunch of features... such as the ability to have nicknames.  Also the auto scroll is still buggy

INSTALLATION
============

```
$ cpan Mojolicious
$ perl app.pl daemon
???
profit!
```
